Genetic Algorithm for Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
This script uses a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), which is all about finding the shortest possible route that visits a list of cities, each city exactly once, and then returns to the starting city.

Key Parts of the Code:
Distance Matrix:

The distance between each pair of cities is stored in a distance matrix. The function generate_random_distance_matrix() creates this matrix randomly, where the distance from a city to itself is zero.
GA Parameters:

population_size: This is how many possible solutions (routes) we have in each generation (default is 100).
generations: The number of generations (or iterations) the algorithm will run for (default is 100).
crossover_rate: The chance that two routes will combine to create a new one (default is 0.8).
mutation_rate: The chance that a route will undergo a small random change (default is 0.1).
How the Algorithm Works:
Creating the Initial Population:
First, we generate a random set of possible routes using initialize_population(). These routes are just different ways of visiting the cities.
Fitness Evaluation:
The fitness of a route is determined by how short it is (i.e., how low the total travel distance is). The fitness() function calculates the total distance for each route.
Selection:
To create new routes, we need to pick the best ones from the current population. The tournament_selection() function helps with this by randomly picking a few routes and selecting the one with the shortest distance.
Crossover:
Crossover is like mating two routes to create a new one. The crossover() function takes two routes and combines them to create a new route. Not every pair will do this—there’s a 80% chance of crossover happening.
Mutation:
Mutation is a random change that can occur in a route to introduce diversity. The mutate() function randomly swaps two cities in the route, with a 10% chance of happening.
Evolving the Population:
In the evolve() function, the population is updated by applying selection, crossover, and mutation. We use a ThreadPoolExecutor to speed up fitness evaluation, so the algorithm runs faster when there are many cities.
The Main Loop:
The run() method loops through the generations, updating the population and keeping track of the best route found so far. At the end, it prints the best route and its total distance.
Parallel Processing:
The fitness evaluation is the most time-consuming part, so that’s the part that’s parallelized. This means we can calculate the fitness for all routes at the same time, making the algorithm faster.
The rest of the operations (selection, crossover, and mutation) don’t get parallelized because they’re faster and don’t need that extra boost.
Why Only Fitness Evaluation is Parallelized:
The fitness function is the most resource-heavy because it calculates the total distance for every route in the population. Since selection, crossover, and mutation are quicker tasks, they don’t need to be parallelized.
Possible Improvements:
Improving Population Regeneration:
Instead of regenerating the entire population when we get stuck, we could keep the best route and only change part of the population.
Adaptive Mutation Rate:
If the population isn’t improving over time, we could increase the mutation rate to introduce more variety and encourage exploration.
Measure Performance:
It would be useful to track how long it takes to run the algorithm and how much better the solutions get over time, so we can tell if the improvements actually help.
Optimization Ideas:
We could reuse a single ThreadPoolExecutor across the entire algorithm to make things even faster.
We could also ensure that there are no duplicate routes in the population by using a set for quick detection.
Multi-Vehicle Problem (Vehicle Routing Problem - VRP):
If we wanted to add multiple cars (or vehicles) to the problem, we’d be moving toward a Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), where the goal is to find the shortest total distance for all vehicles combined, rather than just one.
How We Could Approach This:

Multiple Cars:
Instead of just one route, each car would have its own route to follow. We’d want to minimize the overall distance traveled by all cars, not just one.
Modifying the Fitness Function:
The fitness function would need to be adjusted to calculate the total distance for all the cars' routes combined. Plus, we’d need to make sure that the cars don't exceed their capacity.
Population Representation:
The population would now represent multiple routes for each car, and the algorithm would evolve these routes to find the best solution.
