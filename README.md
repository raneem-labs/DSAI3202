## Running the Game

### Basic Usage
Run the game with default settings (30x30 random maze):
```bash
python main.py
```

### Manual Mode (Interactive)
Use arrow keys to navigate through the maze:
```bash
# Run with default random maze
python main.py

# Run with static maze
python main.py --type static

# Run with custom maze dimensions
python main.py --width 40 --height 40
```

### Automated Mode (Explorer)
The explorer will automatically solve the maze and show statistics:

#### Without Visualization (Text-only)
```bash
# Run with default random maze
python main.py --auto

# Run with static maze
python main.py --type static --auto

# Run with custom maze dimensions
python main.py --width 40 --height 40 --auto
```

#### With Visualization (Watch the Explorer in Action)
```bash
# Run with default random maze
python main.py --auto --visualize

# Run with static maze
python main.py --type static --auto --visualize

# Run with custom maze dimensions
python main.py --width 40 --height 40 --auto --visualize
```

- `--width`: Set maze width (default: 30, ignored for static mazes)
- `--height`: Set maze height (default: 30, ignored for static mazes)
- `--auto`: Enable automated maze exploration
- `--visualize`: Show real-time visualization of the automated exploration

## Maze Types

### Random Maze (Default)
- Generated using depth-first search algorithm
- Different layout each time you run the program
- Customizable dimensions
- Default type if no type is specified

### Static Maze
- Predefined maze pattern
- Fixed dimensions (50x50)
- Same layout every time
- Width and height arguments are ignored

## How to Play

### Manual Mode
1. Controls:
- Use the arrow keys to move the player (<span style="color:blue">blue circle</span>)
- Start at the <span style="color:green">green square</span>
- Reach the <span style="color:red">red square</span> to win
- Avoid the <span style="color:black">black walls</span>

### Automated Mode
- The explorer uses the right-hand rule algorithm to solve the maze
- Automatically finds the path from start to finish
- Displays detailed statistics at the end:
  - Total time taken
  - Total moves made
  - Number of backtrack operations
  - Average moves per second
- Works with both random and static mazes
- Optional real-time visualization:
  - Shows the explorer's position in <span style="color:blue">blue</span>
  - Updates at 30 frames per second
  - Pauses for 2 seconds at the end to show the final state

}

### Question 3 (10 points)
Analyze and compare the performance of different maze explorers on the static maze. Your analysis should:

1. Run multiple explorers (at least 4 ) simultaneously on the static maze
2. Collect and compare the following metrics for each explorer:
   - Total time taken to solve the maze
   - Number of moves made
   - *Optional*:
     - Number of backtrack operations

3. What do you notice regarding the performance of the explorers? Explain the results and the observations you made.

   I ran 4 parallel explorers on the static maze using the modified main.py from Question 2 with this command: python main.py --auto --type static --explorers 4
   results:
   === Exploration Results Comparison ===
Explorer   Time (s)   Moves      Backtracks  Moves/s   
1          8.72       1279       0           146.67    
2          8.65       1279       0           147.86    
3          8.81       1279       0           145.18    
4          8.69       1279       0           147.18    
=====================================

observations:

Consistent Move Counts: All adventurers solved the static maze in exactly 1279 moves.
This ideal consistency results from:
The static maze features a set layout
All adventurers follow the same right-hand rule algorithm; without randomisation in the algorithm, they follow same routes.
Almost Same When to act:
Time taken varied slightly between 8.65 and 8.81 seconds.
The small differences result from:
Differences in system process scheduling
Variations in background CPU load
Variations in memory access timing

Zero Backtracking: There were no backtracking actions taken because
There are no loops in the static maze that could trap the explorers.
The straightforward layout of this maze makes the right-hand rule ideal.
Every dead end has a single entrance and exit.
Metrics of Performance:
The rate of moves per second (~146 moves/sec) was remarkably consistent.
This implies that the computational overhead of the algorithm is constant.
Performance deviations are prevented by the regularity of the static maze.

The Significance of These Findings:
Algorithm Determinism: The algorithm's deterministic nature is demonstrated by its perfect reproducibility.
The same inputs (algorithm + maze) always yield the same results.
Impact of the Maze Structure: The right-hand rule is ideal for the static maze's straightforward hallways and dead ends.
In more intricate mazes, explorers would probably differ from one another.
Baseline Performance:
These findings create a control case that can be compared to: Various maze types (random)
Adapted algorithms
Different approaches to problem solving
Possible Enhancements:
Add Randomization: To possibly discover shorter routes, introduce small variances in decision-making.
For instance, occasionally take left turns rather than always choosing right.
Path Optimisation: Use path memory to prevent going over areas again.
could lower the number of moves in more intricate mazes.
Other Algorithms:
For performance differences, compare to A* or breadth-first search.
These could identify more efficient routes, but the computational costs would vary.





### Question 4 (20 points)
Based on your analysis from Question 3, propose and implement enhancements to the maze explorer to overcome its limitations. Your solution should:

1. Identify and explain the main limitations of the current explorer:

answer:  (A) Deterministic Pathing The current explorer strictly adheres to the right-hand rule at all times, which:consistently generates the same answers for the same maze
Unable to locate alternate, possibly shorter routes. In some maze configurations, it becomes trapped in endless loops.
b) No Recollection of Cell Visits. The explorer:
Unable to recall previously visited cells
may make repeated trips to the same locations.
wastes time by going backwards needlessly.
c) Inefficient Backtracking
When backtracking:
It only looks at the immediate move history
Doesn't optimize the backtrack path
May backtrack too far or not far enough


3. Propose specific improvements to the exploration algorithm:
First Improvement: Choosing a Probabilistic Path
Rather than consistently favouring right turns:
Make the choice of direction random.
Continue to favour right turns, but occasionally consider other options.
aids in breaking free from recurring patterns and discovering new avenues
improvement 2: Went to Cell Tracking. Enhance backtracking to:
To indicate areas that have been explored, a visited cells matrix
Optimising the path to prevent cell revisits
Memory of recent movements in the short term
improvemetn 3: Adaptive Backtracking
Improve the backtracking to:
Examine the complete move history.
Determine the best backtrack locations.
Implement "intelligent" backtracking


5. Implement at least two of the proposed improvements:

Your answer should include:
1. A detailed explanation of the identified limitations
2. Documentation of your proposed improvements
3. The modified code with clear comments explaining the changes

### Question 5 (20 points)

Compare the performance of your enhanced explorer with the original:
   - Run both versions on the static maze
   - Collect and compare all relevant metrics
   - Create visualizations showing the improvements
   - Document the trade-offs of your enhancements
Your answer should include:
1. Performance comparison results and analysis
2. Discussion of any trade-offs or new limitations introduced

### Final points 6 (10 points)
1. Solve the static maze in 150 moves or less to get 10 points.
2. Solve the static maze in 135 moves or less to get 15 points.
3. Solve the static maze in 130 moves or less to get 100% in your assignment.

 ## Challenge Solution

To solve the static maze in 130 moves or less (for full assignment marks):

```bash
python main.py --type static --optimized --auto

Sample successful output:
Optimized solution found in 126 moves
SUCCESS: Solved static maze in 130 moves or less!
Time taken: 0.45 seconds

Note: The --auto flag is required for automated solving


### Implementation Recommendations:

. **In main.py**, ensure the optimized solver is properly imported:
```python
from explorer import OptimizedSolver

### Bonus points (i solved and explained in readme file inside src)
1. Fastest solver to get top  10% routes (number of moves)
2. Finding a solution with no backtrack operations
3. Least number of moves.
