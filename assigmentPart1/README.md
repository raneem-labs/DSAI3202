**Conclusions:**

1. **Sequential Execution:** This is the simplest approach, but it’s usually the slowest because it handles each number one at a time, like waiting in a single line.

2. **Multiprocessing with individual processes:** While this tries to speed things up by handling multiple numbers at once, it can actually end up being slow because creating and managing separate processes for each number adds extra overhead.

3. **Multiprocessing pool with map():** This is a smarter way to use multiprocessing. Instead of creating a new process for every number, it reuses a set of processes, which makes it more efficient.

4. **Multiprocessing pool with apply():** This method is similar to using a pool, but it’s slower than `map()` because it waits for each task to finish before starting the next one, like taking turns instead of working simultaneously.

5. **Concurrent.futures ProcessPoolExecutor:** This is often the best option for parallel processing. It’s efficient, easy to use, and requires less code compared to directly using the multiprocessing module. It’s like having a well-organized team that gets the job done quickly and cleanly.
